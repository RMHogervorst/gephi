Description: 
    Sometimes you want to visualize your graph information in 'gephi'. 
    'Gephi' needs certain column names to make sense of the file. 
    This package writes edge and node information to csv files with
    correct names so you can read it in easily with gephi. 
    You can also read the files in with igraph/tidygraph. It makes it 
    much easier to switch between R and 'gephi'. This R-package does not 
    interface with the open source network visualisation tool 'gephi' but it
    writes and reads csv files in a way that 'gephi' expects, reducing the 
    friction when switching between tools.
