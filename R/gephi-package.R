#' Gephi.

#' Make your workflow with network data easier. The gephi package does not
#' interface with the open source network visualisiation software 'gephi' but
#' only writes csv files in a format that can be easily read by 'gephi'.

#' @section Graphs, networks, edges and nodes:
#' Network science is a broad field with many practicitioners who, unfortunately
#' don't use the same languge to describe the same things. A graph is a network,
#' not to be confused with graphics, or a graph like a scatterplot or line chart.
#' A network (known as graph) consists of points (known as vertices or nodes )
#' and connections between them (known as vertices, links or edges). The gephi
#' network visualisation tool uses edges and nodes as description, igraph
#' talks about graphs G(), vertices V() and edges E(), tidygraph talks about
#' edges and nodes. We don't care as long as we can work with it.
