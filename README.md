gephi
=====

This is a simple package to export files into a csv format that gephi can understand.

I've found the need to convert tidygraph/igraph objects into a node and edge csv, to visualize in gephi quite often. This should be trivial, but gephi is a bit particular and wants specific column names.

What does the package do?
-------------------------

Writes igraph files to csv format that gephi likes. Really? Gephi reads csv files just fine! Sure but it wants the columns in a particular order and named Source, Target etc. Let's not do this by hand everytime: AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF!

Installation
------------

Install this developmental version with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RMHogervorst/gephi")
```

Example
-------

-   igraph to csv
-   tidygraph to csv
-   dataframe to csv

Writing out an igraph file to csv:

``` r
library(gephi)
library(igraph)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'igraph'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     decompose, spectrum
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     union
V(graphexample)
#> + 5/5 vertices, named, from 48f6ce8:
#> [1] a d b c f
E(graphexample)
#> + 5/5 edges from 48f6ce8 (vertex names):
#> [1] a->b a->c a->d d->b d->f
gephi_write_edges(graphexample, "edges.csv")
#> writing edgesgraphexample
#> to edgefile: edges.csv
```

Technically an tidygraph object is also an igraph object so the writing will work the same.

``` r
library(gephi)
library(tidygraph)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'tidygraph'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:igraph':
#> 
#>     groups
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter
graphexample
#> # A tbl_graph: 5 nodes and 5 edges
#> #
#> # A directed acyclic simple graph with 1 component
#> #
#> # Node Data: 5 x 2 (active)
#>   name  color 
#>   <chr> <chr> 
#> 1 a     blue  
#> 2 d     red   
#> 3 b     blue  
#> 4 c     blue  
#> 5 f     yellow
#> #
#> # Edge Data: 5 x 3
#>    from    to weight
#>   <int> <int>  <dbl>
#> 1     1     3     1.
#> 2     1     4     1.
#> 3     1     2     1.
#> # ... with 2 more rows
```

More specifically if you want to modify and visualize a subset of your graph in gephi:

``` r
graphexample %>% 
    activate(nodes) %>% 
    filter(color == "blue") %>% 
    activate(edges) %>% 
    mutate(dongle = "dingle") %>% 
    gephi_write_edges("edges_subset.csv") %>% 
    print()
#> writing edges.
#> to edgefile: edges_subset.csv
#> # A tbl_graph: 3 nodes and 2 edges
#> #
#> # A rooted tree
#> #
#> # Edge Data: 2 x 4 (active)
#>    from    to weight dongle
#>   <int> <int>  <dbl> <chr> 
#> 1     1     2     1. dingle
#> 2     1     3     1. dingle
#> #
#> # Node Data: 3 x 2
#>   name  color
#>   <chr> <chr>
#> 1 a     blue 
#> 2 b     blue 
#> 3 c     blue
```

But is is also possible to write a set of edges when there is no graph object, just a dataframe.

``` r
data.frame(
    start = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),
    finish = c(2,4,4,7,2,1,3),
    weight = c(1,1,1,2,6,1,1)
) %>% 
    print() %>% 
    gephi_write_edges_from_df(path = "edges2.csv")
#>   start finish weight
#> 1     1      2      1
#> 2     2      4      1
#> 3     3      4      1
#> 4     4      7      2
#> 5     5      2      6
#> 6     6      1      1
#> 7     7      3      1
#> writing edges from dataframestructure(list(Source = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), Target = c(2, 
#> to edgefile: edges2.csvwriting edges from dataframe4, 4, 7, 2, 1, 3), weight = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1)), .Names = c("Source", 
#> to edgefile: edges2.csvwriting edges from dataframe"Target", "weight"), row.names = c(NA, -7L), class = "data.frame")
#> to edgefile: edges2.csv
```

``` r
file.remove("edges.csv")
#> [1] TRUE
file.remove("edges2.csv")
#> [1] TRUE
file.remove("edges_subset.csv")
#> [1] TRUE
```
